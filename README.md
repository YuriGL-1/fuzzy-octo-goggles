# Auto Clicker
it's a auto clicker that i create for a game, but i think that can be used for more something.<br>
it start with "ctrl+shift+space", if you want change the hotkey its simple.<br>

![change the hokey and print.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuriGL-1/fuzzy-octo-goggles/refs/heads/main/change12.png)

change the "keyboard.add_hotkey('key+key+key', comecar)", and "print("press KEY+KEY+KEY for enable/disable the auto clicker")"

# Example:
keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+shift+capslock', comecar)<br>
print("press CTRL+SHIFT+CAPSLOCK for enable/disable the auto clicker")

# Observation:
some words were in portugueze(brazil), because its my language
